##Dictionary App

This app gets meanings of a searched word with its transcription and sound pronunciation.
It accepts a valid english word and displays its multiple meaning and uses with examples.
Ths app also displays a random word on refresh as the word of the day.

The app was created using react framework due to it been easy to render and understand.
It was a little tasking rendering all meanings gotten from the API. Fur further revision of the project, I would like to include more meanings to give a 
broader coverage for each word.

Another challenge faced was the handling of errors on get requests to the API'S.

##How to use.
Enter a valid word in the search bar, click on the word if suggested or type out the word and click on Enter key.
The word, it's meanings, part of speech, pronunciation and uses are displayed. It displays its synonyms and antonyms if applicable.

To listen to the word pronunciation sound, click on the volume button.
